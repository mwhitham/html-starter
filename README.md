#HTML Starter#

It includes a bunch of good stuff:

* All the **HTML5 Boilerplate** goodness (http://html5boilerplate.com/);
* **SASS/Compass** ready — just need to `compass watch`;
* **Responsive ready** (only the very basics here... it's really just a starting point - you'll need to adjust on a per project basis);
* Some **accessibility**: **ARIA landmark roles** (a few basic ones: *banner*, *navigation*, *main*, *complementary* and *contentinfo*);
* **Susy** (http://susy.oddbird.net/)
